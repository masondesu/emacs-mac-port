## What is this?

This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 24.  This provides a native
GUI support for Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.9.  Note that Emacs 23 and later
already contain the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for
Mac OS X 10.4 and later.  So if it is good enough for you, then you
don't need to try this.

### *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

If you find a bug, then please try to reproduce it with some
official builds such as X11 or NS (Cocoa).  If it turns out to be
specific to the Mac port, then please report it to
<a href="mailto:mituharu+bug-gnu-emacs-mac@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp">mituharu+bug-gnu-emacs-mac@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp</a>.  Otherwise (i.e.,
it is also reproducible with official ones), report it using <kbd>M-x</kbd>
report-emacs-bug *USING THE OFFICIAL BUILD* as such.

## Features
This build has *many* features, a great number of which are particularly helpful for Mac users. You can see the full list <a href="https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port/blob/master/README-mac.md">here</a>. 

## Installation options


### Download ###

Without clone and compile, just download from

https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port/wiki/Downloads

### Homebrew ###
If you'd like to install with Homebrew, please

`$ brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport`

and then
 
`$ brew install emacs-mac`

To disable this tap, please:

`$ brew untap railwaycat/emacsmacport`

### Use the build script ###

Build a self-contained Emacs.app with build-emacs.app.sh

### Build from the latest
1. Get the latest code from git repository

	If you are new here:
	   `$ git clone git://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port.git`

	If you cloned this repository before:
       `$ git pull`

2. Follow the step h. i. j. in "2. Build instructions" from README-mac

	You can SKIP step a. b. c. d. e. f. and g. because code in this repository was patched already.

### Macports ###
Macports (the package manager) also have emacs-mac-port, with
package name "emacs-mac-app". It's not maintained by me.
